## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS logical prop
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive styling


### What I learned

This was primarily a test for myself to use logical properties on a small project. Originally I thought browser support for them was low, but recent readings led me to see that a majority _are_ supported.

Safari does have limited support for logical border properties but those weren't in use for this project.

It was a good test bed for getting into the mental rhythm of using inline/block over cardinal directions.
